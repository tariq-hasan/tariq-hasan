## About Me
I am a software engineer with extensive experience in **data engineering**, **machine learning**, and **backend development**.

I am passionate about building robust **distributed systems**, designing scalable **data pipelines**, and contributing to the open-source community. My work combines a deep understanding of software development with a strong focus on data and systems engineering.

## Open Source Contributions
I have been a contributor to the **Kubeflow** ecosystem, including:
- **[Kubeflow Katib](https://github.com/kubeflow/katib/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Atariq-hasan):** A scalable hyperparameter tuning system for machine learning workflows.
- **[Kubeflow](https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Atariq-hasan):** A comprehensive machine learning platform built on Kubernetes.
- **[Kubeflow Training Operator](https://github.com/kubeflow/training-operator/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Atariq-hasan):** A Kubernetes custom controller for training machine learning models at scale.

Feel free to explore my repositories or connect to discuss anything related to **software engineering**, **data**, and **distributed systems**!
